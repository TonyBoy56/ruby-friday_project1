      <img src="img/selfie.jpg" alt="A picture of Antonio Cruz">
      <p id="aboutMe">I am an ambitous learner. My hobbies have consisted of music, video games, and computer technologies. My family line derives from Cuban and Hispanic branches, and my brother and I are the first of our family to be naturalized United States citizens. I have moved from several states, consisting of Oregon, Washington, Florida, and Texas, through my father's job search in the Information Technology industry. When we had settled in West Linn Oregon for the following 10 years after the fourth grade, I had attended West Linn high school and graduated with my diploma. Immediately after, I attended Clackamas Community College to acquire my Associates Degree in general studies. In the present, I am eager to learn and expand my ability to code websites and a new interest of dabbling in game development.</p>
